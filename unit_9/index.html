						<h3>Info</h3>
						<p>As a designer I have a passion for connecting people through storytelling and bringing ideas to life. My aim is to create impactful experiences that have the power to foster positive and sustainable change. I deeply enjoy what I do and thrive on the luxury to do for a living what I am passionate about.

						Born and raised in Vienna, Austria, I moved on to live, study and work in Rotterdam, Berlin, London, Zurich and Tokyo. At the moment I am based in Singapore working as design director for the award winning design consultancy Chemistry.

						I have been working as a designer across the globe for many internationally renowned companies and institutions such as KesselsKramer, Tama Bi University (Tokyo), IDEO and the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (O.M.A.). 

						My love for design with a strong impact and a clear social component can be seen in passion projects such as the for-impact-organisation<a href="www.aiducation.org"> Aiducation International </a>which focuses on giving access to education for bright students in developing countries.
